** This gives a glimpse of our development flow

1. Let's learn useState(). Before React 16.8, in any component if we had to use state and setState in a functional component
   then we first had to convert that into a class based component and then use state and setState. Now from React version 16.8
   we can use useState() method inside the function. We are using this now in IngredientForm.js. Note that anything starting 
   with use can be used only inside a functional component and not in class based. Also, in class based if we use state then 
   only a javascript object (and not any other type) can be assigned to the state, whereas anything including the object can 
   be assigned to useState like variables, arrays, objects and so on.
   useState() returns an array of two elements, the first one is the current state (or the updated state) and the second 
   second element in the array is function that allows you to update your first element which is the actual state. 
   We get errors if we do update any particular value out of many values in an object like how we do in setState. We'll see 
   why this happens next.
